# Vancomycin-Pediatrics

Modeling of published clinical vancomycin studies in pediatrics for model evaluation

Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim snapshot file containing simulations of published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of our models regarding vancomycin pharmacokinetics in children, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports, when available.

The reference model repository can be found here:
